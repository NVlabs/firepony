Description: Base quality score recalibrator for NGS data
 Firepony is a base quality score recalibration tool for aligned NGS read data.
 It is a reimplementation of the GATK Base Quality Score Recalibrator algorithm
 in C++ with optional NVIDIA GPU support.
 .
 The output of Firepony is compatible with and can be used by GATK directly in
 a pre-existing NGS processing pipeline.
